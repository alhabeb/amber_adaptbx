Run tests on 3cfb: similar to 1aho, but takes longer :-(

#  simple test case: has alternate conformers, ss bonds, multiple
#    chains per unit cell, non-standard residues, insertion codes

#  does not have:  gaps
#  also of interest: leaving out the use_reduce=False is OK, but gives
#           slightly different results

To run the tests:

./test_amber_3cfb

OR, to run individually:

./test_AmberPrep      (takes 153 sec on dac laptop)
./test_phenix.refine  (takes 590 sec on dac laptop)

#  Note: LES tests fail as of May, 2020, since code that creates the
#  4phenix_3cfb.pdb file doesn't include the insertion codes
