Run tests on 3cfb: similar to 1aho, but takes longer :-(

#  simple test case: has alternate conformers, ss bonds, multiple
#    chains per unit cell, non-standard residues, insertion codes

#  does not have:  gaps
#  also of interest: leaving out the use_reduce=False is OK, but gives
#           slightly different results

To run the tests:

./test_AmberPrep      (takes 153 sec on dac laptop)
./test_phenix.refine  (takes 590 sec on dac laptop)
