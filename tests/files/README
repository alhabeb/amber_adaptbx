Notes:  (dac, Aug. 2018)

1.  The "real" test that should be run is in the 1aho folder: see
    the README file there.  There are also good tests in the 3cfb
    folder, but these take longer to run.

2.  1gdu, 2g3i, 3kug  directories contain potential examples of LES problems
    - started in dir: casegroup:/home/pjanowsk/Phenix/test_100/test100
    - took all pdb codes (23 pdbs) having alternative conformations.
    - run: phenix.AmberPrep dir_to_pdb_file LES=True minimise=phenix_all
    - got all pdb codes that caused failure
    - add them (pdb files) to the folders here

3.  Other folders, like 2igd, 4lzt, fake and vAla3 have various, mostly
    abortive attempts to make useful test files
