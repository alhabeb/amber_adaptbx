    - dir: casegroup: /home/pjanowsk/Phenix/test_100/test100

        - first, I took all pdb codes (23 pdbs) having alternative conformations.
        - run:
            phenix.AmberPrep dir_to_pdb_file LES=True minimise=phenix_all
        - got all pdb codes that caused failure
        - add them (pdb files) to test folder
