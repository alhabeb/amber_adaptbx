Created an artifical "gap" in 1aho.pdb by removing residues 60 and 61.

This should be a good test case: has disulfide bonds, alternate locations,
more than 1 asu in a unit cell, and (now) a gap.

To run the tests:

./test_AmberPrep      (takes 13 sec on dac laptop)
./test_phenix.refine  (takes 57 sec on dac laptop)

Current limitations (27sep17):

1. there are two scripts, rather than one (combine?)  Note that the second
       test does *not* depend on successful output from the first test.
2. The LES part is commented out for now  (but should not be hard to change)
3. The phenix.refine test leaves behind an amber1.log file, which might be
       useful to examine, but is left behind whether or not the test passes.
