Created an artifical "gap" in 1aho.pdb by removing residues 60 and 61.

This should be a good test case: has disulfide bonds, alternate locations,
more than 1 asu in a unit cell, and (now) a gap.

To run the tests:

./test_amber_1aho    which just performs the following steps:

./test_AmberPrep      (takes 13 sec on dac laptop)
./test_phenix.refine  (takes 57 sec on dac laptop)
./test_AmberPrep_LES  (takes 13 sec on dac laptop)
./test_phenix.refine_LES  (takes 45 sec on dac desktop)
