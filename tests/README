Notes:

The tests that phenix automatically runs are in 
     $PHENIX/modules/phenix/phenix/command_line/amber_run_tests.py

One can also run these manually:

     cd $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/files/1aho
     ./test_AmberPrep
     ./test_phenix.refine
     ./test_AmberPrep_LES
     cd $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/files/3cfb
     ./test_AmberPrep

These are "regression tests" that check that phenix.AmberPrep and
phenix.refine with useAmber=True continue to give correct results.
The scripts will write PASSED or FAILED to stdout (along with other
info), and will return 0 on success on 1 on failure.

==========================================================================
Descriptions below are for a test suite that Hai Nguyen put together.
But some of these are now outdated, so they would need some work to
get working again.  These are more like "unit tests".

1. How to run?

Note: add "-s" if you want to see more verbose

- Run test from anywhere
    phenix.python -m pytest $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/ -m 'medium' -v

- Run a given test
    phenix.python -m pytest $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/ -k name_of_the_method -v
    e.g: phenix.python -m pytest $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/ -k test_build_from_pdb_that_does_not_have_remark_290 -v

- Run test for a given file
    phenix.python -m pytest /path/to/that/file -v
    e.g: phenix.python -m pytest $PHENIX/modules/amber_adaptbx/tests/les/test_builder.py -v

2. If you do not want to read lots of stuff, just try

- run most of the tests (recommended):

    make

- run full ong tests (hours):

    make test.all

- To debug, you can run simple test

    phenix.AmberPrep 2igd.pdb LES=True clean=False

3. Further info
- Check Makefile
- Check __doc__ in ./run_tests.py

4. To collect all the test names

./run_tests.py --collect-only
