Notes:

The tests that phenix automatically runs are in 
     $PHENIX/modules/phenix/phenix/command_line/amber_run_tests.py

These are "regression tests" that check that phenix.AmberPrep and
phenix.refine with useAmber=True continue to give correct results.
The scripts will write PASSED or FAILED to stdout (along with other
info), and will return 0 on success on 1 on failure.
