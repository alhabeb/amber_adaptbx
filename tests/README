Notes:

The tests that phenix automatically runs are in 
   /home/case/phenix/modules/phenix_regression/amber

These are "regression tests" that check that phenix.AmberPrep and
phenix.refine with useAmber=True continue to give correct results.
Run like this:

     phenix.python tst_amber_xx.py

These should return "OK" on success, and also leave a folder with full
results, in case one wants to dig further.  The data used for these tests
in the "files" folder.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other folders here have older tests, that are probably of little use any more,
but I'm keeping some around just in case.
