Notes:

(1) One test harness for amber_adaptbx is this:
     $PHENIX/modules/phenix/phenix/command_line/amber_run_tests.py

These are "regression tests" that check that phenix.AmberPrep and
phenix.refine with useAmber=True continue to give correct results.
The scripts will write PASSED or FAILED to stdout (along with other
info), and will return 0 on success on 1 on failure.  But this is not
run by default, and not all of these tests have been kept up to date.

(2) The tests that are run "by default" are here:

     $PHENIX/modules/phenix_regression/amber

Each of the tst_amber_xx.py scripts are run.

(3) Inside the amber_adaptbx/tests folder, the local versions of the tests
in item (2) above are in the "files" folder.  Other files/folders in the
tests folder are older attempts at tests.  Most/all of these should probably
be removed to reduce confusion  (dac, 9/21).
